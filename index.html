		<p id="paragraph1">Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
			and remember what peace there may be in silence.
			As far as possible without surrender
			be on good terms with all persons.
			Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
			and listen to others,
			even the dull and the ignorant;
			they too have their story. </p>

		<p id="paragraph2">Take kindly the counsel of the years,
			gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
			Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
			But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
			Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
			Beyond a wholesome discipline,
			be gentle with yourself. </p>

		<p id="paragraph3">You are a child of the universe,
			no less than the trees and the stars;
			you have a right to be here.
			And whether or not it is clear to you,
			no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should @.
